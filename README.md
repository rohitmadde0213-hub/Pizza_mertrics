🍕 Pizza Runner SQL Analysis Project

This project is a complete end-to-end SQL analysis based on the Pizza Runner dataset. It focuses on understanding customer behavior, evaluating runner performance, optimizing ingredient usage, and calculating pricing and revenue. The goal of this project is to demonstrate strong SQL skills through real-world business problem solving using structured queries, data cleaning, and analytical thinking.

The project is organized into four main analytical sections:

Pizza Metrics

Runner & Customer Experience

Ingredients & Customization Analysis

Pricing and Revenue Analysis

Each section is stored in a separate SQL file for clarity and maintainability.
